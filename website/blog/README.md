# Oscar's blog
This directory contains the blog posts that can be found at [https://owelton-rosie.pages.dev/blog](https://owelton-rosie.pages.dev/blog).

It's important to note that the file that indexes all the blog posts (`blog.html`) is in the root directory (that's [https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/OWelton-Rosie/tree/main/website](`website`)), not the `blog` directory. (This directory: [https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/OWelton-Rosie/tree/main/website/blog](https://github.com/OWelton-Rosie/OWelton-Rosie/tree/main/website/blog)).

It's equally important to note that all the assets (CSS, JS, favicon) in the blog posts are fetched from the published site. This means that:
- Local testing requires an internet connection
- Blog posts take slightly longer to load than pages in the `website` directory
