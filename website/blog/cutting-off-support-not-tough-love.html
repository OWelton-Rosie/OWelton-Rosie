        <h1>Cutting off welfare for 18-19 year-olds is not just "tough love" - it's neglect</h1>

    <p>On the 5th of October, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/575025/jobseeker-parents-earning-more-than-65k-must-support-18-19yo-children" target="_blank">the government announced</a> that 18-19-year-olds whose parents have a combined annual income of $65,000 per year will be unable to access the Jobseeker Benefit. The changes are estimated to affect 4,300 New Zealanders.</p>

    <p>In a <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/politics/360844741/pm-says-jobseeker-benefit-cut-young-kiwis-bit-tough-love" target="_blank">press conference</a> , Christopher Luxon called it "a bit of tough love", but labelling it as such does not make it true. For too many New Zealanders, this move is a step towards financial insecurity.</p>

    <p>Consider this: the median annual wage per person is <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/money/350385856/are-you-taking-home-median-weekly-wage-nz#" target="_blank">about $70,000 per year</a>. By setting the combined threshold at less than the median wage per parent, this policy will exclude thousands of families who are by no means wealthy - and who may already struggle to support themselves.</p>

    <p>For thousands of New Zealanders, this is not "tough love". It's a sudden shove into financial insecurity. Not all families with an income of over $65,000 per year can - or will - support their children. Many young people already juggle responsibilities. Stripping them of welfare does not teach responsibility. Rather, it forces them to survive on luck, charity or underpaid work.</p>

    <p>This is not about "tough love". It's about ignoring the realities of life in New Zealand. It's a policy that will hurt those whom it claims to protect.</p>

    <p>If the government truly cared about empowering young adults, it would provide actual investment in education, training and support services - not cut a lifeline for those trying to stand on their own two feet.</p>

    <p>Calling this "tough love' is a convenient excuse for a policy that is reckless. Young people deserve guidance, not abandonment and neglect.</p>

    <p>I hope to have access to support services in the current years, but with the government's current attitude to policy, hope alone will not be enough.</p>
